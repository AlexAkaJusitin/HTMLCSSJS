      Hello, I am Alex and I don't really fucking know what I'm doing

        >I wanna get to the serious stuff.. So, as you have read, I am Alex, a
        dreamer. Life wasn't always nice to me and I love that, because it made
        me realise how many people can be sad and how many people are actually
        wanting to end it. I've been dreaming that someday I could do something
        to help all of you, you know, to unite everyone and maybe...Change the
        world, I guess. My wish is that somehow I get good enugh to program some
        kind of application that can connect each and everyone of you that are
        going trough hard stuff and maybe you could just talk, make jokes and
        forget about whatever is making you sad in the first place. I am alone
        as of now, as a programmer, but I have plenty of friends(actually 3-4)
        that support my idea, I think I have plenty of time to do something big,
        I am only 16 years and 11 months old, turning 17 soon. I know it's hard
        to be a programmer. I am currently learning small things about
        <strong>HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT</strong> , but with time, I think I have
        the potential to develop something that can do some changes. I also want
        a hell lot of money, not for me, but for this planet, I want to raise as
        much value as I can to donate it to humans that actually need it. I
        think things will turn out very good in the end, or so I hope.</em
