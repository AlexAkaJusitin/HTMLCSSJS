      (me on the left side and him on the right side) Vasy is my best friend and
      cousin at the same time! We want to create this website to make an impact
      on the world! We want to recruit everyone that has a good heart and a
      willing of change.He is the same age as me, but a baby because he is 8
      days younger. We both know we will be
      <strong>big CEOs</strong> so if you see this website now expect good
      money! He knows a lot about financial stuff, and he will be working with
      my employees(ours).
